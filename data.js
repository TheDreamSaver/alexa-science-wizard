When you rub the balloons against your hair or the fabric they become negatively charged, they have taken some of the electrons from the hair/fabric and left them positively charged.They say opposites attract and that is certainly the case in these experiments, your positively charged hair is attracted to the negatively charged balloon and starts to rise up to meet it. This is similar to the aluminium can which is drawn to the negatively charged balloon as the area near it becomes positively charged, once again opposites attract.In the first experiment both the balloons were negatively charged after rubbing them against the woolen fabric, because of this they were unattracted to each other."

                "explanation":"Hopefully your parachute will descend slowly to the ground, giving your weight a comfortable landing. When you release the parachute the weight pulls down on the strings and opens up a large surface area of material that uses air resistance to slow it down. The larger the surface area the more air resistance and the slower the parachute will drop. Cutting a small hole in the middle of the parachute will allow air to slowly pass through it rather than spilling out over one side, this should help the parachute fall straighter. "

Friction is the force that opposes the movement of one substance against another. In this case, we had rice and a chopstick.  As the rice sits in the bottle, there are air pockets around most grains, which prevents friction. As we push the chopstick into the bottle, the grains of rice settle close to one another eliminating most of the air pockets. Once this happens, the frictional force overwhelms the rice and so the rice will push against the chopstick. In fact, the grains are pushing so forcefully, they create a force that causes the chopstick to become stuck enabling you to pick up the bottle of rice. "

When we hold the paper in front of a light source, the oily patches appear translucent. Appearance of oily patch on the paper indicates the presence of fats in peanuts and dry coconut. Rice grains do not change the texture of paper as they do not contain fats. Oily patches become translucent because paper has a tendency to absorb oil. Fat is another food component present in many of our food items. Like carbohydrates, these are also energy-yielding components of the food."
